# About Me

Hi, I'm Niklas Binder, a PhD student at University Hospital Tübingen in the Schürch Lab. My research focuses on investigating the tumor microenvironment of various malignancies using spatial omics approaches.

## Research Interests

My work aims to uncover the complex interactions between cancer cells and their surrounding environment, with a particular focus on how spatial organization influences tumor progression and treatment response. By employing cutting-edge spatial omics technologies, I'm working to develop a deeper understanding of tumor heterogeneity and its clinical implications.

## Background

Prior to joining the Schürch Lab, I worked at the Institute of Neuropathology in Freiburg, where I investigated tumor-associated macrophages within the microenvironment of various brain tumors. This research combined single-cell and spatial omics techniques to characterize immune cell populations and their roles in brain cancer progression.
